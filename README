This is a deck list for the most recent version of the 1994 Magic: The Gathering deck that I used to win the World Championships.  Note that some other cards could be rotated in to the deck based on the current meta-game, such as Braingeyser, Mana Vault, Copy Artifact, Control Magic, Tormod's Crypt, Feldon's Cane, Zur's Weirding, Old Man of the Sea, Birds of Paradise.  Also, the sideboard of Hurkyl's Recall, Circle of Protection: Red, etc, is not included.
